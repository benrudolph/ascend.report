## Introduction

SMS as a tool for humanitarian aid is becoming an increasingly common tool. UNHCR Innovation recently piloted an SMS system in two UNHCR operations: Esmeraldas, Ecuador and San Jose, Costa Rica. Along the way we made a few blunders and also did a few things right. We wanted to share our experiences piloting FrontlineCloud in San Jose, Costa Rica so that you could learn from us.

The project, named Ascend, began as a collaboration between Stanford University and UNHCR Innovation. The two institutions developed a class called “Rethinking Refugee Communities.” From this, Ascend was born out of a student group with the initial intention of tackling early camp registration by using mobile phone devices. The course took the students though the design process: research, challenge definition, ideation and prototyping. Along the way, UNHCR Innovation colleagues were in contact with the students to provide feedback.

About six months after the course ended, Ascend iterated based on needs and limitations discovered in Ethiopia. Ascend shifted from a tool to help registration to general purpose messaging. A few key takeaways were observed: one, the need for message classification to handle a large number of inbound SMS (think Gmail classifying messages as priority or not priority; two, the ability to have a feature rich application to conduct polls and surveys via SMS; three, a focus on visualizing the data received and report generation in order to convey effectiveness to potential donors.

By the end of 2013, the Ascend group was adopted into UNHCR Innovation where the project would continue and have better access to piloting locations. The decision was made to use FrontlineSMS as a prototype with the goal of better understanding SMS in humanitarian contexts. The first pilot was conducted, as mentioned, in Esmeraldas, Ecuador. In April 2014, FrontlineCloud was piloted in San Jose, Costa Rica.


## Choosing to prototype

Before any plans and preparations were made, we asked ourselves, “What do we hope to achieve with this prototype?” This framed our pilot with specific objectives. The goals for this particular pilot were:

1.	How do we best utilize SMS to connect with an urban refugee population
2.	How do we embed a new tool like SMS in organizations to be sustainable, even after the pilot is over?
3.	What types of utilities does an SMS application need to appropriately handle the desires of UNHCR and NGO staff?

These questions arose from gaps and assumptions we made when conceptualizing the SMS system as well as from the previous pilot in Esmeraldas, Ecuador. With our priorities set, we could now start to frame the pilot to answer these questions.  Based on these goals, we chose to pilot FrontlineCloud. FrontlineCloud was an off the shelf solution for SMS that would easily let us answer these questions without having to invest vast amounts of time and resources to build our own system only to find out later that SMS perhaps wasn’t an ideal tool for urban refugees.

## Identifying a location

The location and population you test on can greatly impact the results of your pilot. We found it important to understand the biases that Costa Rica would bring to our results. There were multiple reasons for choosing San Jose.

*	Interest from “the field” – At UNHCR, headquarters is known for implementing new projects on already overworked field staff. In the case of Costa Rica, we received a request from their office to pilot the SMS program.  With both headquarters and the field operation committed to working on the project, we believed the pilot would have a much higher probably of success.
*	Stability within the region – While no refugee situation is truly stable, it is fair to say the refugee situation in Costa Rica is less turbulent than a place like Lebanon. In extreme emergency situations such as Lebanon, things like providing food, water and shelter are rightly prioritized over an SMS pilot.
*	Mobile phone precedence – Not all UNHCR operations deal with a population that have mobile phones or even cell signal to send messages. In some areas, the literacy rate isn’t high enough for it to make sense to use SMS as a tool of communication. However, Costa Rica ended up being an ideal operation where both literacy rates and cellphone usage were quite high.*

While it isn’t always the best to prototype in an ideal location, for our purposes we thought it would be the best way to discover how to best use SMS. We made the bet that more and more locations will have higher literacy rate and mobile phone penetration as time goes on rather than less. In this way, we hope that more operations will be similar Costa Rica in the future.

## Preparation

The first stage of any of our innovation projects revolves around ensuring that the need for that project actually exists. This was done in Costa Rica through focus groups and discussions with UNHCR and NGO staff. Through these methods we decided to focus on three areas that SMS could immediately impact. This helped us define the scope of the project and where we’d focus our efforts. We identified these areas:


*	Job opportunity alerts – One of the NGOs we were working with, ACAI, had a job placement program. Currently they were having difficulty notifying all of the people they helped what new jobs were available. SMS could easily provide a way to notify the relevant population, especially since ACAI had a database of phone numbers that they’d like to contact.
*	Participatory Assessments – In a few months time, UNHCR Costa Rica would be conducting Participatory Assessments, which are surveys that UNHCR gives to refugees to evaluate different aspects of the operation. We planned to use SMS as a way to notify and remind people to complete the assessment.
*	Microcredit Program – The last program we’d tackle was a Microcredit program established by an organization called Aprode. Aprode gives out small loans incrementally to refugees as well as other Costa Ricans to start businesses. Throughout the process though, it’s important for Aprode to maintain contact with the people they’ve lent money to in order to assess whether they would need more assistance or potentially need more money.

We concretely designed our scope for the pilot so that we’d have clear areas we could focus on during the arrival. No matter the preparation though, we learned that the scope often grows as we respond to real world contexts.

### Choosing a champion

A champion is someone within the organization where you will be piloting that is enthusiastic and a strong supporter of the project. This person often pushes the project and ensures that it succeeds.  For many reasons identifying a champion is critical for the success of the pilot. I cannot stress enough how essential this aspect is to embedding a project within an institution.

Early on with Costa Rica we identified our champion, Valentina Duque. She was instrumental in coordinating implementation, getting key stakeholders involved and ensuring follow through from various other organizations.

### Preparation tasks

Depending on the pilot, there’ll be a varying number of tasks that need to be completed before the pilot takes place. When I first began piloting projects, I had the tendency to offload all of the work from the operation onto myself in order to save the operation some time and effort. I’d advise against this for two reasons. One, if the operation is unable to complete a few tasks before the pilot because of time constraints, this often is an indication that the operation does not have the time capacity to take on this pilot. Two, when the documents come from the operation, I’ve found that there is more ownership over the pilot and thus there is a greater effort to make the pilot succeed. We worked with the Costa Rica operation to complete these tasks before the pilot began:

*	Contact database development - This comprised of aggregating the disparate sources of phone numbers from ACAI, Aprode and UNHCR. With one Excel sheet with all of the phone numbers, we could get started quickly (WC).
*	Monitoring and evaluation plan – Before starting the pilot, we wanted to agree on outputs that we’d focus on and the indicators to help measure the success at achieving those outputs.
*	Pilot implementation plan – A rough plan of how the software will be rolled out to the various organizations.
*	Software and phone installation – To ensure that everything would work upon arrival, we walked through the installation of Frontline over video conference.

## Implementation

Even after months of preparation, the ability to improvise on the ground is almost always a necessity. In Costa Rica the biggest hiccups came when it was time to run the actual FrontlineCloud software. Here was our process for an 11-day mission.

## Community involvement

At UNHCR Innovation, we try as hard as possible to keep refugees at the center of our work. That means that for pilots and projects we try to get as much feedback from refugees as we can. Before the implementation of the project, we sat down with four refugees to engage in a conversation about communication with organizations like UNHCR. We've anonymized the interviews and posted our notes for your [viewing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bMDeYQ0fI1IrIPhDY2ofc4iKdH96ln03KL-8HOw5nY4/edit). In short, some key takeaways were:

* Phone presence - Most of the interviewees had phones and used them, though some only used it for family matters. Many cited it as a good means of reaching them. There were also a couple who said it was better to call rather than send an SMS.
* SMS uses - By and large, most of the interviewees wanted more information on activities and opportunities that were available to them. In addition, some thought it would be a good way to ask questions to UNHCR, ACAI or Aprode.
* Challenges faced - The biggest challenges for the refugees upon arrival was surviving in a context they were not used to. In a similar vein, they also found it very difficult to find jobs.

From these interviews we were able to begin formulating ways to address the challenges presented by the refugees. At the end of the monitoring and evaluation phase, we again got in contact with the same refugees to get their opinion on the program. These interviews were conducted over the phone and can be viewed here. The responses were overwhelmingly positive which is a huge success for the pilot as a whole.

## Followup and Monitoring

Now that FrontlineCloud had been installed and trainings had been conducted, the monitoring and evaluation plan (M&E) that was setup upon arrival and then reviewed before the end of the pilot became essential. I would argue this is one of the most important part of running a pilot.

When done correctly, M&E allows us to iterate on our solution. Without it we are merely guessing at how to improve. For Costa Rica we chose the indicators listed below as the ones we would record. There was a fine balance between overly bureaucratizing the process, reducing the quality of information recorded and selecting too few indicators, making it difficult to determine how to iterate.

| Indicator | Purpose |
| -------- | -------- |
| # of messages sent per week | This is to measure organization's engagement with SMS system   |
| % of PoC interested in using SMS to communicate with UNHCR | This is to measure the population of concern's interest in the project |
| # of PoC participating in the pilot | To determine growth of system. |
| % of PoC who actively send messages to UNHCR staff | To measure the population of concern's engagement with the system |

We conducted a three-month period of monitoring. The first six weeks included Skype meeting each week to detail progress of the system. During the meetings we would discuss things that were going well and thing that weren’t. These sessions were also critical for understanding how the system was performing.

At the end of the three-month evaluation period, we created two surveys for Costa Rican staff to complete. One survey was for those that interacted with the FrontlineCloud software directly, while the other was for those in the organization that did have direct contact with the software but were still able to send messages through their focal point.

In addition to gathering feedback from the staff members themselves, we also conducted interviews with refugees who had been receiving SMS from FrontlineCloud.

## Lessons Learned

After the monitoring for three months, we underwent the process of consolidating and process the data to come up with tangible lessons learned from the pilot. These lessons served to shape the steps we take to improve the solution.

*Technical Issues*

A host of issues with the software became apparent when working with FrontlineCloud. All these issues have been reported to Frontline and hopefully will be corrected in the future.

*	Uploading contacts to the system – Frontline offers a way to upload your contact database to the system through importing a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file. Two issues arose around using a CSV file. The first was that, with varying degrees of technical literacy, many people did not know what a CSV was or how to generate one. Secondly, Frontline suggests that you use an Excel sheet and “Save as” .csv file. This works well for some countries. However, in a host of countries, including Costa Rica, Excel saves your CSV file and delimits fields with a semicolon rather than a comma. This is due to the fact in many countries a comma is used a decimal point and thus would not serve well to delimit a CSV file. In order to change this, one has to modify the Region and Language settings on Windows, which is not intuitive even for technical minded person. The lesson here is that when UNHCR chooses its platform it should accept Excel files or CSV files as a way to import contacts.
*	Uploading large amounts of contacts to the system – Frontline chokes when too many contacts are uploading via CSV. We were receiving load times of over an hour when trying to upload 600 contacts. This is a huge limitation, especially when dealing with operations that have tens of thousands of contacts.
*	Ability to handle other languages – Frontline offers the ability to translate the app into a variety of languages. This was great for Costa Rica because we needed it to be in Spanish. Two issues arose with this: one, some pieces of texts were missing translations; two, some functionality was broken due to the accent marks. The former was more of an issue. The software would crash when sending polls with the word “sí.” It would also crash when trying to delete messages if the applications language was set to Spanish.
*	Issues with syncing messages – In places where the Internet goes out from time to time, SMS software needs to be able to handle syncing with spotty Internet. Frontline worked well when the connection was great. However, we experienced difficulties in buildings where the Internet would sporadically go out. The result was sometimes duplicate messages in the system, or worse, missing messages.
*	Other minor issues – There were a few other minor issues when using the platform. Some of the layout would break when addressing a message to too many contacts. The search would break if you typed too quickly.

*Trust Building*

Initially we had started the pilot with a prepared list of contacts to message. Sending the blast welcome message explaining the project elicited many responses saying, “Who is this?” or “Why am I receiving this?” After interviewing refugees we began to see a pattern. People were hesitant to trust a message from an unknown number. We ended up tackling this issue by first advertising the number in UNHCR and the other NGOs so that people would become familiar with the program and expect to receive messages. In addition to that, we setup boxes where people could drop their contact information and we would then add that phone number to the Frontline database. In this way we increased trust in and awareness for the program.

*Invalid or unused phone numbers*

Currently, there is no functionality in FrontlineCloud that enables you to determine whether a phone number you just messaged is inactive. This ended up being an issue since the contact databases were well-known to be out of date. Therefore, the only people we could assume received the SMS are those that responded. In fact, to get a better estimate of the number invalid phone numbers in use, one of the UNHCR workers did a small case study on the existing contacts. (talk about the 50 phones called). After this discovery, UNHCR worked with ACAI to update the database.

*Number of contacts*

*Consistent SMS programming*

One strategy that worked well for UNHCR was setting up a consistent messaging program. Every week UNHCR would send out some sort of asylum related fact or interesting event that was happening. This became a way for UNHCR to engage with its users on a weekly basis and received many positive responses from the receivers.

*Institutional knowledge of the system*

A very difficult part of running a pilot is embedding the system knowledge within the organization. We accomplished this through establishing a champion for the project who would be able to carry on the project after UNHCR Innovation had left. In addition to this, we ran as many trainings as possible with UNHCR, ACAI and Aprode. We had two sets of trainings. The first was a brief overview of the system designed for those who wouldn’t be directly interacting with the system. It lasted for an hour. The second part was more in depth with hands-on practice, geared to those who would be using Frontline.

*Time of sending the messages*

We knew it took hours sometimes even a whole day to send bulk messages to hundreds of contacts. However we overlooked the fact that if we send the message at 6pm, many of the messages won’t be delivered until the wee hours of the morning. We received a few complaints about this and promptly decided that broadcast messages had to be sent in the morning or they’d have to be delayed until the next day.
