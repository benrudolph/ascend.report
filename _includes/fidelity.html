  <b>Prototype Fidelity</b>

    Above depicts a graph UNHCR Innovation often considers before deciding on our prototype. The x axis defines the time spent creating the prototype. The y axis defines the fidelity, or the quality of, the prototype. The two are often correlated. The more time you spend building a prototype the higher quality it will be. There is a tendency to pour lots of time into the creation of the perfect prototype. However, this can be detrimental to the success of the project. At the beginning it's important to invest less time in the prototype so that it is possible to iterate quickly. This is where the philosophy of "fail fast" originates.

    For Ascend, using FrontlineCloud was a relatively low fidelity, low time prototype. It can be setup and mastered within a week. The tradeoff was a tool that did not exactly match our vision for a UNHCR SMS platform.
