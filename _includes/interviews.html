  <b>Interviews vs. Focus Groups</b>
  <p>
    Deciding between interviewing a user or creating a focus group can be tricky, both have their pros and cons. We often choose to go with interviews when we're looking to gain a deeper understanding of an issue. With one-on-one contact, we're able to dig deeper and ask questions that may be sensitive to talk about in a group setting. One technique we use often is called "the five whys." This technique requires you to ask why to an answer five times before going on to a different topic. This has been highly effective at uncovering the root causes of issues.

    Focus groups are great when you want to get advice on a topic. With everyone in the room, brainstorming can happen much more freely. Your responsibility is only to facilitate the conversation which allows you to focus on the ideas and conversation that is taking place.
